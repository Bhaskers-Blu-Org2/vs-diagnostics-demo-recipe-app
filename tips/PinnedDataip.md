# Pinned DataTips
When you hover over a variable in Visual Studio, a DataTip is displayed that allows you to inspect the object. DataTips are dismissed when you move the mouse cursor outside the DataTip, which can be frustrating. If you want to keep the DataTip around, just use the pin icon on the left to 'pin' it in the editor and keep it in place.

1. Pause the debugger.
2. Hover over a variable.
