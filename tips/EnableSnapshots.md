## IntelliTrace - Enabling Snapshots
IntelliTrace is part of Visual Studio Enterprise, and one of the most compelling features of IntelliTrace is the new **snapshot** feature. Snapshot powers the **Step Back** and **Snapshot Exception** features of IntelliTrace. With these features, you can view the state of your application as it was at a point in the past with full fidelity.  

### Enabling via Tools Options 
1. Open the **Tools --> Options** dialog and locate the **IntelliTrace --> General** options and select the **IntelliTrace events and snapshots**

Snapshots will be enabled starting with the next debug session.
